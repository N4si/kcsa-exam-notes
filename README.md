# KCSA (Kubernetes Certified Security Associate) Study Notes

I'm **Nasiullha Chaudhari**, and I recently passed the KCSA exam. I created this comprehensive study guide to help others prepare for this challenging certification. This repository covers all six domains of the 2025 KCSA exam curriculum with practical examples, official documentation references, and real-world scenarios.

## About This Guide

This guide is based on my personal experience preparing for and passing the KCSA exam. I've structured it to be practical, technical, and focused on what you actually need to know for the exam. Each section includes hands-on examples and links to official Kubernetes documentation.

## Exam Overview

The KCSA is a pre-professional certification designed for candidates interested in advancing to the professional level through a demonstrated understanding of foundational knowledge and skills of security technologies in the cloud native ecosystem.

**Exam Details:**
- **Format:** Multiple choice (unlike hands-on Kubernetes exams)
- **Duration:** 90 minutes
- **Cost:** $250 USD (includes one free retake)
- **Passing Score:** 75%
- **Validity:** 3 years
- **Delivery:** Online, proctored

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts
- Familiarity with containerization technologies
- Basic knowledge of security principles
- Linux command line experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts
- Familiarity with containerization technologies
- Basic knowledge of security principles

### Setting Up Practice Environment
For hands-on practice, set up a local Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# Install and start Minikube
minikube start

# Enable metrics server
minikube addons enable metrics-server

# Verify cluster is running
kubectl cluster-info

# Test with sample deployment
kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080
```

## Study Tips

Based on my experience taking the KCSA exam:

1. **Focus on understanding concepts** rather than memorizing commands
2. **Practice with real Kubernetes clusters** when possible
3. **Read the official Kubernetes documentation** - many questions reference it directly
4. **Understand the security implications** of each component and configuration
5. **Practice threat modeling** and thinking like an attacker
